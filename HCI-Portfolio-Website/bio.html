          <p class="general-headers">Where I have lived: </p>
          <p class="general-information">I was born in Chicago on December 1st, 2001.
            I have lived in a few different states at a very young age, such as New Mexico,
            Michigan, and Colorado. I then moved to Kansas in the 2nd grade and have lived there
            ever since. </p>
          <p class="general-headers">My family: </p>
          <p class="general-information">Both of my parents went into the field of medicine.
            Besides them, I have an older sister and three dogs that I love very much. </p>
          <p class="general-headers">Me now: </p>
          <p class="general-information">I am currently a Junior at Northwestern University majoring
            in Economics and minoring in Computer Science. I am looking to graduate early and go into
            the field of Wealth Management. Outside of school and my career, I like to play soccer, ski,
            and have recently started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. Additionally, I am a poker theory enthusiast
            and enjoy participating in the men's mental and physical health awareness organization known
            as Movemeber as a student ambassador. </p>
          <p class="general-headers">Fun facts: </p>
          <p class="general-information">I thought I would end this page with a few random fun facts.
            The first of which is that I was a regional/state level wrestler in high school but had to quit
            due to repetitive shoulder subluxations and one major dislocation. The second is a simple oneâ€”
            my favorite thing to eat is watermelon. The last fun fact is that I am an uncle. </p>
