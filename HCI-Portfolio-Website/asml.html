          <p class="general-headers">Overview: </p>
          <p class="general-information">ASML Holdings is a Dutch photolithrogaphy equipment
            producer founded in 1984 and based in the Netherlands. They are the first to provide
            EUV lithography technology, and have used the fact that their competitors are limited
            to selling DUV lithography technology to capture roughly 60% of the lithography technology
            market. Key customers include Samsung, TSMC, and Intel. </p>
          <p class="general-headers">Competitive Advantages: </p>
          <p class="general-information">ASML’s scale is what puts it above competitors.
            EUV lithography is helping them to pursue Moore’s Law. They are, as of now, the only EUV company,
            and this has and will continue to erode competitor market share/profits as major chip
            companies make EUV more mainstream— with the current rate of technological innovation, we will see a higher
            demand for EUV as chip producers look for more efficient and powerful chips. Additionally, their current size allows them to implement
            fast-shipment measures to counter supply chain bottlenecks and retain customer base—
            a prevelant issue plaguing the semiconductor industry. </p>
          <p class="general-headers">Risks: </p>
          <p class="general-information">Their reliance on a select few customers can prove dangerous, especially as these large
            companies can look to options other than EUV lithography equipment in the short term when supply
            constraints arise. Exposure to China will also prove troublesome, however ASML has done well to reduce China exposure
            and is expected to continue to do so. </p>

          <p class="general-headers">Technicals: </p>
          <p class="general-information">Semiconductor industry reached around $600 billion in 2021 and is projected to be a trillion-dollar
            industry by 2030 with a 6-8% CAGR (according to McKinsey in April 2022). Regarding fundamentals, ASML has maintained a very
            strong balance sheet with high cash flow over the last few years. As of 3Q22, ASML had: an EBITDA of 4.335 Billion, Cash at 3.15
            Billion, and Debt hovering around 4.4 Billion. Technical valuations, primarily market comps, place the company at a fair value of
            around 650 per share.</p>
